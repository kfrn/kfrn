Hi, I'm Katherine. 

I work full-time in software development, currently writing Python and TypeScript, and even a bit of C#.

Audiovisual preservation was my previous career, and it remains a passion! You can see a few projects related to that here. Otherwise, my Github history mainly consists of various toy apps and little projects. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
